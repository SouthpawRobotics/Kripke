# Kripke Robot Code
This repository is to hold the code for the demonstration bot used by The Southpaw Robotics, Team 479. The robot that this code runs on was built specifically for use on demonstrations and other activities to promote the team. The code was originally in EasyC but has been ported to RobotC for the coming season.
